// TODO add lua intergration

- lua needs to be able to communicate with inputs and sending / receive packets.

- lua api example:

bot:start()
  - start the robot. enables movement and timer.

bot:stop()
  - stops the robot. disables movement and timer.

bot:reset()
  - resets the robots internal timer.


bot:time()
  - get the robots time since started.


bot:set_motors(motors)
  - send motor values to the robot.

bot:get_motors()
  - get the current motor speeds.

// TODO send and receive robot state packets

- because the robots are relatively simple in function, their whole state (such
  as motor speeds and maybe range finder values) can be sent in a single packet
  periodically and then stored.

  This is better than sending a 'get_motor_speed' packet for example and then
  waiting for a return packet to read.

// TODO auto detect serial COM path

- this should be easy to do since platformio does it.

// TODO add packet display gui element

- parse and display different packet types in both hex and humand readable form
  not unlike the way wireshark does their packet display.
